# Not Enough Energistics
NotEnoughEnergistics is a port of [Just Enough Energistics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-enough-energistics-jee) to Minecraft 1.7.10

This mod replaces AE2's default NEI integration for the Pattern Terminal.

By default, AE2 forces the player to either have the necessary items for a recipe in their personal inventory or in their ME network.

This mod removes that functionality and allows the player to use NEI's transfer system (the [?] button) to create patterns whether the player possesses the items required by the recipe.
